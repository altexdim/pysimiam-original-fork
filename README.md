## Courses

* **Control of Mobile Robots by Dr. Magnus Egerstedt**  
Learn about how to make mobile robots move in effective, safe, predictable,  
and collaborative ways using modern control theory.  
https://www.coursera.org/course/conrob

* **Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots**  
In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation  
with quadrotors, including topics such as probabilistic state estimation,  
linear control, and path planning.

* **Visual Navigation for Flying Robots**  
In recent years, flying robots such as autonomous quadrocopters have gained  
increased interest in robotics and computer vision research. For navigating  
safely, these robots need the ability to localize themselves autonomously  
using their onboard sensors. Potential applications of such systems  
include the automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings, inspection and  
simple maintenance tasks, surveillance of public places as well as  
in search and rescue systems.

* **Artificial Intelligence for Robotics. Programming a Robotic Car.**  
Learn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader  
of Google and Stanford's autonomous driving teams. This class will teach you  
basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including: probabilistic inference,  
planning and search, localization, tracking and control, all with a focus  
on robotics. Extensive programming examples and assignments will apply  
these methods in the context of building self-driving cars.
